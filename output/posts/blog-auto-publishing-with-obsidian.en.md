## Why Is Publishing a Single Post So Complicated?

In [my last post](https://ironpark.github.io/posts/my-ideal-dev-blog/), I talked about why I started this blog and how I chose the technologies. This time, I want to discuss why publishing even a single post on this blog turned out to be so complicated, and how I tried to untangle that process.

The biggest inconvenience Iâ€™ve experienced running a static blog based on GitHub Pages is **the publishing process itself**.

Since thereâ€™s no separate database or server environment, thereâ€™s no management page or dedicated editor. As a result, the basic writing flowâ€”drafting â†’ saving â†’ editing â†’ publishingâ€”is not smooth. On top of that, having blog posts and frontend code mixed together in one repository is almost a disaster for someone like me who easily gets sidetracked. So, **separation of concerns** became absolutely necessary.

### Everyone Has a Plausible Plan
![get-punched-in-the-face](/posts/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian/get-punched-in-the-face.jpg)

**My plan was this:**
1. Write posts in Obsidian
2. Use a Git plugin to automatically sync to my personal repository
3. Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy posts to the blog repository

I was confident this would be a perfect system allowing me to write and publish posts instantly from anywhereâ€”smartphone, tablet, or desktop. I could focus solely on writing in Obsidian, and the rest would be handled automatically by the magic of GitHub Actions... such a beautiful plan.

Although it worked perfectly in my head, in reality, there were more hidden pitfalls than I expected.

## Exploring Solutions

### First Plan

![blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian.en.md 1 mermaid image](/posts/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian.en-1.svg)

The biggest concern was **the entanglement of automatic commits and manual commits within the same repository**.  
What happens if GitHub Actions automatically commits and deploys posts while Iâ€™m editing CSS or layout locally?

Most likely, when I try to push, the remote repository will already have commits generated by automation. In that case, `git push` will be rejected, and Iâ€™ll have to go through the tedious process of resolving conflicts by running `git reset HEAD^ & git pull`.

In other words, the automation designed to help me publish posts could easily turn me into a **full-time conflict resolution officer**.

### Second Plan
The root cause of the problem was that the automation process commits blog posts directly to the main branch.

So, what if **posts were fetched dynamically at build time?**

![blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian.en.md 2 mermaid image](/posts/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian.en-2.svg)

This way, **the post repository and the blog code repository are completely separated**. Each commits independently in their own domain, only meeting at build time. Conflicts? They simply canâ€™t happen in this structure.

But this structure had a fatal flaw: **a public repository had to fetch data from a private repository**. This is a reverse access pattern that goes against common security principles.

My Obsidian Vault isnâ€™t just a blog repository. Itâ€™s my personal digital brain containing private diaries, work notes, project ideas, and sometimes sensitive information. The idea of a public blog accessing this personal repository was unsettling.

I considered cloning the private repo using a Personal Access Token, but the risks were too high:

- Sensitive info might be exposed in the public repositoryâ€™s Actions logs
- Security risk if the token is stolen, exposing the entire Vault
- Risk of accidentally including private files in the build process

Most of all, I didnâ€™t trust myself enough to proceed with this plan, so it was scrapped.

### The Final?

So I changed my approach. What if I committed automatically to the blog repository as originally planned, but used a separate branch?

![blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian.en.md 3 mermaid image](/posts/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian/blog-auto-publishing-with-obsidian.en-3.svg)

In this structure:
- GitHub Actions in the Vault repo processes posts and pushes to the blog repoâ€™s `auto-sync` branch
- The blogâ€™s build process checks out and merges both `master` and `auto-sync` branches before building
- Design or code changes are committed directly to the `master` branch as usual

This setup completely eliminates the possibility of conflicts while securely connecting the two repositories.

### Challenges Encountered
1. Obsidian Syntax  
Obsidian uses its own markdown extensions. Image embeds like `![[image.png]]` or wiki links like `[[another note]]` donâ€™t render properly in standard markdown preprocessors. A conversion preprocessing step was essential.

2. Image Paths and Asset Management  
Images in the Obsidian Vault are usually stored in the same folder as notes, but on the web, itâ€™s common to use a unified path like `/assets/images/`. Images had to be copied to the correct location and paths adjusted during the build.

3. Multilingual Support and AI Translation  
I wanted the blog to be available in Korean, English, and Japanese. Writing posts in three languages every time was impossible, and my foreign language skills are limited, so I introduced AI translation. However, careful handling was required to avoid translating technical terms or code blocks.
