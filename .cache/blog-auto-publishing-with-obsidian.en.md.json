Obsidian)","subTitle":"Everyone Has a Plausible Plan","description":"A fully automated system that automatically publishes your writing to the website just by writing and saving in Obsidian.

This time, I want to discuss why publishing even a single post on that blog is so complicated, and how I tried to untangle that process.\n\nThe biggest inconvenience I felt while running a static blog based on GitHub Pages is **the publishing process itself**.\n\nSince there is no separate database or server environment, there’s no management page or dedicated editor. As a result, the basic writing flow — draft → save → edit → publish — isn’t smooth. On top of that, having blog posts and frontend code mixed together in one repository is almost a disaster for someone like me who easily gets sidetracked. So, **separation of concerns** became absolutely necessary.\n\n### Everyone Has a Seemingly Good Plan\n![[get-punched-in-the-face.jpg]]\n\n**The original plan was like this:**\n1. Write posts in Obsidian\n2. A Git plugin automatically syncs to a personal repository\n3. GitHub Actions automatically deploy posts to the blog repository\n\nI was confident this would be a perfect system where I could write and publish posts instantly from my smartphone, tablet, or desktop. I would focus solely on writing in Obsidian, and the rest would be handled automatically by the magic of GitHub Actions... such a beautiful plan.\n\nAlthough it worked perfectly in my head, in reality, there were more hidden pitfalls than I expected.\n\n> Everyone has a seemingly good plan — until they get punched in the face.\n\n## Exploring Solutions\n\n### First Plan\n\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nautonumber\nparticipant Developer as 👨‍💻 Author\nparticipant Obsidian as 🪨 Obsidian\nparticipant VaultRepo as 📁 Vault Repository\nparticipant BlogRepo as 📁 Blog Repository\nparticipant Pages as 🌐 GitHub Pages\nDeveloper ->> Obsidian: Write blog post\nObsidian ->> VaultRepo: Sync commit\nNote over VaultRepo: Run blog post filtering commit action\nVaultRepo ->> BlogRepo: Commit blog post\nNote over BlogRepo: Build & deploy\nBlogRepo ->> Pages: Deploy static site\nNote over Developer: Edit CSS locally, commit\nDeveloper ->> BlogRepo: 💥 Attempt commit push (commit B)\nrect rgb(250,200,200)\nBlogRepo -->> Developer: ❌ REJECTED! remote changes exist <br/> Need to pull before commit → possible conflicts (mix of auto and manual commits)\nend\n```\n\nThe biggest concern was the **entanglement of automatic commits and manual commits within the same repository**.  \nWhat happens if GitHub Actions automatically commits and deploys posts while I’m editing CSS or layout locally?\n\nMost likely, at the moment I try to push, the remote repository will already have commits created by automation. In that case, `git push` will be rejected, and I’ll have to go through the tedious process of resolving conflicts by doing `git reset HEAD^ & git pull`.\n\nBecause of automation designed to publish posts, I almost became a **full-time conflict manager**.\n\n### Second Plan\nThe root cause was that the automation process committed blog posts directly to the main branch.\n\nSo, what if we **fetch posts dynamically at build time?**\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nautonumber\nparticipant Developer as 👨‍💻 Author\nparticipant Obsidian as 🪨 Obsidian\nparticipant VaultRepo as 📁 Vault Repository\nparticipant BlogRepo as 📁 Blog Repository\nparticipant Pages as 🌐 GitHub Pages\n\nDeveloper ->> Obsidian: Write blog post\nObsidian ->> VaultRepo: Sync commit\nNote over VaultRepo: Save posts\n\nDeveloper ->> BlogRepo: Edit CSS/layout\nBlogRepo ->> BlogRepo: Trigger build\n\nrect rgb(200,250,200)\nNote over BlogRepo: Start build process\nBlogRepo ->> VaultRepo: Fetch post data (checkout)\nVaultRepo -->> BlogRepo: Markdown files\nNote over BlogRepo: Preprocessing & site build\nend\n\nBlogRepo ->> Pages: Deploy static site\n```\n\n\nThis way, **the post repository and the blog code repository are completely separated**. Each commits independently in their own domain, only meeting at build time. Conflicts? Such things simply cannot occur.\n\nHowever, this structure had a fatal flaw: **the public repository would have to fetch data from a private repository**. This is a reverse access that violates common security principles.\n\nMy Obsidian Vault is not just a simple blog repository. It’s my personal digital brain containing private diaries, work notes, project ideas, and sometimes sensitive information. The idea of a public blog accessing this personal repository was unsettling.\n\n- Risk of sensitive information leaking in public repository’s Actions logs\n- Security risk of the entire Vault being exposed if the token is compromised\n- Risk of accidentally including private files in the build process\n\nMost of all, because I don’t trust myself, this plan was scrapped.\n\n### The Final?\n\n![[Neon-Genesis-Evangeliongendo-Ikari-Gendo.jpg]]\n> Post publishing system ~~humanity~~ improvement plan final version\n\nSo I changed my approach. **What if I automatically commit to the blog repository as originally planned, but use a separate branch?**\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n subgraph subGraph0[\"Private Vault Repo\"]\n direction TB\n A[\"Obsidian notes\"]\n B[\"GitHub Actions\"]\n C[\"Preprocessing & translation\"]\n end\n subgraph subGraph1[\"Public Blog Repo\"]\n direction TB\n D[\"auto-sync branch\"]\n E[\"master branch\"]\n F[\"Github Actions\"]\n end\n subgraph subGraph3[\"User\"]\n direction TB\n H[\"Blog design edits\"]\n I[\"Commit\"]\n J[\"Push\"]\n end\n A --- B\n B --> C\n C --commit--> D\n D -. checkout .-> B\n D -. checkout .-> F\n E -. checkout .-> F\n F --> G[\"Github Page\"]\n H --- I --> J --> E\n style A fill:#f9f\n style D fill:#9f9\n style F fill:#bbf\n```\nIn this structure:\n- GitHub Actions in the Vault process posts and pushes them to the blog repository’s `auto-sync` branch\n- The blog’s build process checks out and merges both `master` and `auto-sync` branches before building\n- Design or code edits are committed directly to the `master` branch as usual\n\nThis structure completely eliminates the possibility of conflicts while securely linking the two repositories.\n\n## Things Not Covered in This Post\n\nAlthough posts written in Obsidian basically follow Markdown format, applying them directly to the blog was difficult. So I had to create a separate preprocessor, and encountered several issues during that process. I didn’t cover these here but plan to write about them separately when I get the chance.\n\n1. **Obsidian Syntax**  \n    Obsidian uses its own extended Markdown syntax. For example, image embeds like `![[image.png]]` or wikilinks like `[[another note]]` don’t render properly in standard Markdown renderers. So a preprocessing step to convert these was essential.\n    \n2. **Image Paths and Asset Management**  \n    Image files in the Obsidian Vault are usually stored in the same folder as the notes, but on the web, a unified path like `/assets/images/` is commonly used. At build time, images had to be copied to the correct location and paths adjusted accordingly.\n    \n3. **Mermaid Diagram Support**  \n    This post uses mermaid.js for diagrams. However, to render these properly in a static site build, a special processing method supporting dynamic rendering was necessary.\n    \n4. **Multilingual Support and AI Translation**  \n    I wanted to offer the blog in Korean, English, and Japanese. Writing in all three languages every time was difficult, and my foreign language skills were limited, so I introduced AI translation. However, the Markdown syntax sometimes got corrupted or altered during translation, requiring several prompt adjustments.\n\n## Implementation\n```yaml\nname: Contents Sync\n# This workflow syncs contents between the main branch and the blog branch.\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    # Run only when specific files change to avoid unnecessary workflow reruns\n    paths:\n      - \"2.Areas/Blog/*.md\"\n      - \".github/workflows/**\"\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  sync:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Get current date\n        id: date\n        run: echo \"::set-output name=date::$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')\"\n      # Checkout brain repository (current repository)\n      - name: Checkout brain repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          path: brain\n      \n      # Checkout auto-sync branch of ironpark.github.io\n      - name: Checkout contents repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          repository: ironpark/ironpark.github.io\n          ref: auto-sync\n          path: contents\n          token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}\n\n      # Install pnpm & cache settings for auto-sync branch of ironpark.github.io\n      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4\n        name: Install pnpm\n        with:\n          version: 10.12.4\n          run_install: false\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n          cache: \"pnpm\"\n          cache-dependency-path: contents/pnpm-lock.yaml\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        working-directory: contents\n        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile\n\n      - name: Sync Contents\n        run: |\n          # Clean up old contents (posts, assets, output)\n          rm -rf /contents/{posts,assets,output}\n          \n          # Create directories and copy files\n          mkdir -p /contents/{posts,assets}\n          cp -r /brain/2.Areas/Blog/*.md /contents/posts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No markdown files found\"\n          cp -r /brain/Z.Assets /contents/assets 2>/dev/null || echo \"No image assets found\"\n      \n      - name: Build Contents\n        working-directory: contents\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          pnpm build\n      # Check for changes in contents and push if there are any changes\n      - name: Check for changes\n        id: check_changes\n        working-directory: contents\n        run: |\n          git add .\n          if git diff --staged --quiet; then\n            echo \"changes=false\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"No changes detected\"\n          else\n            echo \"changes=true\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Changes detected\"\n          fi\n      # Push Contents if there are any changes\n      - name: Push Contents\n        if: steps.check_changes.outputs.changes == 'true'\n        working-directory: contents\n        run: |\n          git config --global user.email \"auto-sync-action@github.com\"\n          git config --global user.name \"auto-sync-action\"\n          git commit -m \"sync contents from ${{ steps.date.outputs.date }}\"\n          git push origin auto-sync\n      - name: Run Publish\n        run: gh api /repos/ironpark/ironpark.github.io/dispatches -f event_type='post-sync'\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}\n```\n## Future Plans\n\nCurrently, publishing status is managed with the `published` metadata, but in the future, I plan to create a scheduled publishing system that quietly posts articles on predetermined dates.\n\nAdditionally, I’m considering features like automatically cross-posting to other platforms such as Velog or Medium after a certain time, or sharing summaries and links on social media like Twitter (X) and LinkedIn simultaneously with publishing. However, when or if these will be implemented is still uncertain.\n\n> It’s still just an idea, but the goal is to squeeze every bit of free tier usage out of GitHub Actions. (At this point, it feels less like the machine is working and more like I’m being overworked.)\n\n---\n\n> 💡 **Curious about this automation system?**\n> \n> You can check out the full code on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ironpark/ironpark.github.io).  \n> Especially take a look at the action files in the `.github/workflows/` folder for detailed implementation.\n>\n> If you want to build a similar system, feel free to ask questions anytime. Let’s create a better writing environment together."}
